Compile:
javac PiBenchmark.java

Run:
java PiBenchmark [digits] [repsPerThread] [threads]

Example Test Scenarios:
A light, quick test (good for a laptop):
java PiBenchmark 2000 500 4
(Calculates 2000 digits, 500 times per thread, on 4 threads)

A heavy stress test (good for a server):
java PiBenchmark 10000 1000 32
(Calculates 10000 digits, 1000 times per thread, on 32 threads)

To compare your machines: 
Run the exact same command on all of them (e.g., java PiBenchmark 5000 1000 8). The machine with the highest CalcPerSec score is the winner.

/**
 * PiBenchmark
 * * A simple, cross-platform Java CPU benchmark tool that calculates Pi
 * to a specified number of digits using multiple threads.
 * * This tool is designed to be run from the command line to test CPU performance.
 * * How to compile:
 * javac PiBenchmark.java
 * * How to run:
 * java PiBenchmark [digits] [repsPerThread] [threads]
 * * Arguments:
 * [digits]:        The number of decimal places to calculate Pi (e.g., 5000)
 * [repsPerThread]: The number of repetitions EACH thread will run (e.g., 1000)
 * [threads]:       The number of concurrent threads to use (e.g., 8)
 * * Example:
 * java PiBenchmark 5000 1000 8

Command-Line Arguments: The program will expect three arguments:

[digits] (e.g., 5000)
[repetitions] (e.g., 10000)
[threads] (e.g., 8)

Internal Logic:
Warm-up: It will first run a warm-up loop (e.g., 10% of the requested repetitions) to allow the JIT compiler to optimize the code. This phase will not be timed.
Threading: It will create a "thread pool" with the specified number of threads.

Workload: It will divide the total [repetitions] among the available threads. For example, 10,000 reps on 8 threads means each thread does 1,250 calculations.
Timing: It will start a high-precision timer (System.nanoTime()) right before dispatching the work to the threads and stop it after all threads have finished.
Algorithm: It will use Java's built-in BigDecimal class to perform the Pi calculation using a computationally intensive algorithm (like a Machin-like formula). This is 100% cross-platform.

Output:
When starting, it will print a confirmation line, e.g.: Starting test: 5000 digits / 10000 repetitions / 8 threads
When finished, it will print a single, simple line with the result: Total time: 1425.78 ms
